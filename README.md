# Google Maps Autocomplete Example with Detailed Information

This project is a simple example of how to use the Google Maps API to implement an autocomplete search bar and display detailed information about the selected location. It also provides driving directions between two selected locations.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you need to obtain a Google Maps API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Once you have the key, replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the script tag in the HTML file with your API key.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. In the "Loading Area" input field, enter the starting location for the directions search.
4. In the "Unloading Area" input field, enter the destination location for the directions search.
5. Select a location from the autocomplete suggestions or enter a custom location.
6. Detailed information about the selected location will be displayed below the search bar.
7. Driving directions between the two selected locations will be displayed in the panel below the maps.
